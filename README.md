The addon picks from thousands of common adjectives and nouns, and randomly chooses to use either 1 or 2 adjectives, whether or not to capitalize words, and to either concatenate them by joining or separating with an underscore. This provides a vast number of possible combinations to be used.

JohnDone is available on [Mozilla Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/johndone).
