JohnDone
========
A simple Firefox Add-on to generate usernames to be used when signing up for various websites and help prevent your identity being linked with your other activities online.

The add-on has two ways of generating usernames:

In the "real words" mode it picks from thousands of common adjectives and nouns, and randomly chooses to use either 1 or 2 adjectives, whether or not to capitalize words, and to either concatenate them by joining or separating with an underscore. This provides a vast number of possible combinations to be used.

In the "made-up words" mode it will create fictional words.
